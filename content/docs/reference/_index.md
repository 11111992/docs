This section provides an overview of the Cloud Native Buildpack API specification. Most
buildpack users won't need this information unless they are writing a buildpack or
a platform that supports buildpacks.

The Cloud Native Buildpack API specification consists of the following parts:

* [Buildpack API](/docs/reference/buildpack-api) - defines the interface between a buildpack and the environment that runs a buildpack.
* [Platform API](/docs/reference/platform-api) - defines the interface between the environment that runs a buildpack a platform that supports it.
* [Distribution API](/docs/reference/distribution-api) - defines the artifact format, delivery mechanism, and order resolution process for buildpacks.
