      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s walk through a build that uses extensions, step by step. We will see an image extension that installs curl on the builder image, and switches the run image to an image that has curl installed.&#xA;Check system requirements Before we get started, make sure you&amp;rsquo;ve got the following installed:&#xA;Install Docker Install pack Ensure Docker is running docker version If you see output similar to the following, you&amp;rsquo;re good to go!</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s see a build that requires base image extension in order to succeed.&#xA;Examine hello-extensions buildpack detect cat $PWD/samples/buildpacks/hello-extensions/bin/detect The buildpack opts-out of the build (exits with non-zero code) unless the BP_EXT_DEMO environment variable is set.&#xA;If the BP_EXT_DEMO environment variable is set, the buildpack detects (exits with code 0), but doesn&amp;rsquo;t require any dependencies through a build plan unless the BP_REQUIRES environment variable is set.&#xA;build cat $PWD/samples/buildpacks/hello-extensions/bin/build The buildpack tries to use vim at build-time, and defines a launch process called curl that runs curl --version at runtime.</description>

      <description>Examine vim extension tree $PWD/samples/extensions/vim You should see something akin to the following:&#xA;. ├── bin │ ├── detect &amp;lt;- similar to a buildpack ./bin/detect │ ├── generate &amp;lt;- similar to a buildpack ./bin/build ├── extension.toml &amp;lt;- similar to a buildpack buildpack.toml The extension.toml describes the extension, containing information such as its name, ID, and version, as well as the Buildpack API that it implements. Though extensions are not buildpacks, they are expected to conform to the Buildpack API except where noted.</description>

      <description>Platforms can have several run images available, each tailored to a specific language family - thus limiting the number of installed dependencies for each image to the minimum necessary to support the targeted language. Image extensions can be used to switch the run image to that most appropriate for the current application.&#xA;Examine curl extension detect cat $PWD/samples/extensions/curl/bin/detect The extension always detects (because its exit code is 0) and provides a dependency called curl.</description>
